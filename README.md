# Java Program Execution Instructions

This repository contains a Java program. Follow the instructions below to compile and run the program.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

* **Java Development Kit (JDK):** You need a JDK installed to compile and run Java programs. Oracle JDK or OpenJDK are recommended. You can download them from the official Oracle or OpenJDK websites.
* **Environment Variables (Optional but Recommended):** Setting up `JAVA_HOME` and adding `%JAVA_HOME%\bin` (Windows) or `$JAVA_HOME/bin` (Linux/macOS) to your `PATH` environment variable simplifies command-line usage.

## Compilation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```
    Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of your GitHub repository and `<repository_directory>` with the name of the cloned directory.

2.  **Navigate to the Source Directory:**
    If your Java source files are in a specific directory (e.g., `src`), navigate to it:
    ```bash
    cd src
    ```
    If your java file is directly in the cloned directory, skip this step.

3.  **Compile the Java Code:**
    Use the `javac` command to compile the Java source files. If your main class is `Main.java`, execute:
    ```bash
    javac Main.java
    ```
    If you have multiple `.java` files, you can compile them all at once:
    ```bash
    javac *.java
    ```
    If your code is in packages, compile from the base directory of the package structure. For example, if you have `com/example/Main.java`, from the directory containing `com`, run:
    ```bash
    javac com/example/Main.java
    ```
    Or to compile all files in the package:
    ```bash
    javac com/example/*.java
    ```
    This will generate `.class` files in the same directory as your `.java` files.

## Execution

1.  **Navigate to the Directory Containing the `.class` Files:**
    If you compiled from a subdirectory, ensure you are in the directory containing the compiled `.class` files.

2.  **Run the Java Program:**
    Use the `java` command to execute the main class of your program. If your main class is `Main`, execute:
    ```bash
    java Main
    ```
    If your main class is in a package (e.g., `com.example.Main`), execute from the base directory (the directory containing `com`):
    ```bash
    java com.example.Main
    ```

## Example

Assuming your repository contains a file `src/HelloWorld.java` with the following content:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

The steps would be:

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  `cd src`
3.  `javac HelloWorld.java`
4.  `java HelloWorld`

This will output:

```
Hello, World!
```

## Troubleshooting

* **"javac: command not found" or "java: command not found":** Ensure your JDK is installed correctly and that the `bin` directory of your JDK is added to your `PATH` environment variable.
* **"Error: Could not find or load main class":** Verify that you are running the `java` command from the correct directory and that the class name is spelled correctly. If your class is in a package, use the fully qualified name (e.g., `java com.example.Main`).
* **Compilation Errors:** Carefully review the error messages from the `javac` command. They usually indicate syntax errors or missing dependencies in your code.
* **Dependencies:** If your project uses external libraries (JAR files), you will need to include them in the classpath during compilation and execution. For example:

    ```bash
    javac -cp "lib/*" Main.java
    java -cp ".;lib/*" Main
    ```
    (Replace `lib/*` with the actual path to your JAR files and adjust the path separator (`:` for Linux/macOS, `;` for Windows) accordingly.)
